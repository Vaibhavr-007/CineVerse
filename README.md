## Description

Building a Real Time Movie Tickets Booking App With React , Node , Express , Mongo , Antd

* `React` - I chose it because it provides a powerful and efficient way to build dynamic user interfaces. With its reusable components, React helps me create a highly interactive and responsive application.
* `Node.js`- Because of its ability to handle server-side operations efficiently, its scalability for handling large numbers of concurrent requests, and its extensive ecosystem of modules and libraries
* `Antd` - Because it offers pre designed UI components
